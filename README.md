## Overview
This repository contains Python code implementing linear regression and logistic regression models. Please note that this is for educational purposes only(to demonstrate understanding of linear regression)

## Files
1. **linear_regression.py**: Contains the implementation of the LinearRegression class.
2. **logistic_regression.py**: Contains the implementation of the LogisticRegression class.
3. **main.py**: Script to demonstrate the usage of the models models.

## Dependencies
To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. **numpy**: For matrix computations.
2. **scikit-learn**: For the classification dataset in logistic regression.
3. **matplotlib**: For visualization.

You can install these dependencies by creating a virtual environment and running the command:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository folder.
3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using the command mentioned above.
4. Run the command:
```bash
    python main.py
```
## Functionality
1. **Linear Regression**: Numpy was used to generate sample data. The code includes options for updating weights with momentum and without momentum.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Uses data generated from make_classification function in scikit-learn's datasets module.

You can see the usage of both regression models in the main.py file.
